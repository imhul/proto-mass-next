# React + Pixi.js + Zustand Browser Game ![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.8.4-brightgreen`)

## Technologies Used

- [React 19.1.1](https://reactjs.org)
- [Zustand 5.0.8](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/)
- [PixiJS 8.13.2](https://pixijs.com)
- [Tailwind CSS 4.1.12](https://tailwindcss.com) + [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- [TypeScript 5.9.2](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Vite 7.1.5](https://vitejs.dev)
- [ESLint 9.35.0](https://eslint.org)

The decision to abandon [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Next](https://nextjs.org) was made for obvious reasons, because this project is not about **SSR**. The open source repository is on [GitHub](https://github.com/imhul/proto-mass-next).
